# Heart Failure Clinical Data Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project based on the **Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset**.  
The objective of this project is to analyze clinical features and explore their relationship with patient survival outcomes.

---

## Project Objective
To perform exploratory data analysis on a real-world healthcare dataset and identify significant factors associated with heart failure mortality.

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of clinical records of heart failure patients and includes the following attributes:

- Age  
- Anaemia  
- Diabetes  
- High Blood Pressure  
- Smoking  
- Ejection Fraction  
- Serum Creatinine  
- Serum Sodium  
- Platelets  
- Follow-up Time  
- Death Event (Target Variable)

---

## Tools and Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Google Colab 

---

## Methodology
The following steps were performed in this project:

- Data loading and inspection  
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Statistical and correlation analysis  
- Data visualization  
- Interpretation of analytical results  

---

## Key Findings
- Age and ejection fraction demonstrated a notable relationship with survival outcomes.  
- Serum creatinine and serum sodium levels were observed to be important indicators of mortality risk.  
- Lifestyle-related attributes such as smoking and diabetes showed measurable influence on survival.  
- Visual analytics facilitated better understanding of complex clinical data.
